Grasp my soul with your wondrous words.
Lead me, lead me from this place.
I have found nothing, nothing worth holding onto.
My eyes have been opened to the bountiful plea raging within my battered chest.
Take my wistful existence and make it, make it new.
Father, Messiah, Creator, Redeemer, I have chosen you.
Allow the fire in me to burn so bright, bringing glory, glory to your name.
All the things I have said, I have felt and thought have broken me into nothing.
Bringing me down in the deepest and darkest fabricate place where I belong.
Wash me clean, crafting a new member of the Body.
